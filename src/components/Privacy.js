        <p>
          Shannon's Tables Inc. (hereinafter “Shannon's Tables”) maintains
          this site (the “Site”) for your personal entertainment, information,
          education and communication. Shannon's Tables takes your privacy
          seriously and is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.
          Because we do gather certain types of information from visitors to the
          Site, we have developed a privacy statement to help you understand the
          terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that
          information. This statement discloses the types of information we
          gather, how it is used, and how you can edit any data that we&#39;ve
          collected about you at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Guiding Principles: </strong>
          Shannon's Tables respects the privacy of individuals who visit the
          Site, send us email, or participate in features/services we offer
          online. Accordingly, our policy regarding online privacy has been
          developed using the following guiding principles: Shannon's Tables
          maintains a strict “no-spam” policy. Subscribers to our email services
          or any other feature/service found on the Site will not receive
          unsolicited email messages from Shannon's Tables. Shannon's Tables
          collects information online primarily to provide our visitors with a
          more relevant experience on the Site. When doing so, we will make
          every reasonable effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of
          data. Shannon's Tables will take reasonable physical, electronic and
          managerial measures to safeguard and secure any information you
          provide to us (e.g. data will be stored in protected databases on
          secured servers with restricted access). Shannon's Tables will not
          share any information you have provided to us with anyone without your
          consent other than to provide the service you have requested. At the
          time you register for any such service, you will be notified of, and
          asked to consent to, the sharing of your information with any
          particular third party necessary to the provision of the requested
