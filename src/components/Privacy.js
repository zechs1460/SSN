        <p>
          Claudio Dental Lab Inc. (hereinafter “Claudio Dental Lab”) maintains
          this site (the “Site”) for your personal entertainment, information,
          education and communication. Claudio Dental Lab takes your privacy
          seriously and is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.
          Because we do gather certain types of information from visitors to the
          Site, we have developed a privacy statement to help you understand the
          terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that
          information. This statement discloses the types of information we
          gather, how it is used, and how you can edit any data that we&#39;ve
          collected about you at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Guiding Principles: </strong>
          Claudio Dental Lab respects the privacy of individuals who visit the
          Site, send us email, or participate in features/services we offer
          online. Accordingly, our policy regarding online privacy has been
          developed using the following guiding principles: Claudio Dental Lab
          maintains a strict “no-spam” policy. Subscribers to our email services
          or any other feature/service found on the Site will not receive
          unsolicited email messages from Claudio Dental Lab. Claudio Dental Lab
          collects information online primarily to provide our visitors with a
          more relevant experience on the Site. When doing so, we will make
          every reasonable effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of
          data. Claudio Dental Lab will take reasonable physical, electronic and
          managerial measures to safeguard and secure any information you
          provide to us (e.g. data will be stored in protected databases on
          secured servers with restricted access). Claudio Dental Lab will not
          share any information you have provided to us with anyone without your
          consent other than to provide the service you have requested. At the
          time you register for any such service, you will be notified of, and
          asked to consent to, the sharing of your information with any
          particular third party necessary to the provision of the requested
          service.

          are most frequently visited and helps us to tailor the Site to the
          needs and interests of our online visitors. In addition, this tracking
          data may be used to tailor information presented to you on our Site

          portions of the Site, is securely maintained on our Web server and
          internal systems. This information may be used to complete your
          transaction, provide you with information you have requested about our
          company, our products and our services, or to provide you with
          information about, or samples of, our product range for marketing
          purposes. When we request information on our Site, some requests are
          marked as “Required”; this information is necessary to allow you to

          opt-out of receiving future communications at any time (see the
          Opt-Out Procedures section below). This data may also be used to
          tailor your experience on our Site by providing content that is
          relevant to your interests and geographic region. Finally, we may
          create aggregated information from information you provide us (such as
          demographic data) for use in updating and maintaining the Sites. This
          aggregated information will not be shared with others except as noted
          below (see the “Disclosure of Personal Information” and “Use of
